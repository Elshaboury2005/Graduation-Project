--------------------------
THE MOST CRITICAL MODULE IN THE CHAOSLAB RELIABILITY ENGINE.

Safety Guarantees
-----------------
This module is the **single authority** through which every fault injector
and the experiment runner must pass before any Docker-level action is taken.

Guarantees provided:

1. **Allow-list enforcement** — only the exact set of services this platform
   owns (``ALLOWED_TARGET_SERVICES``) can ever be targeted.  An attacker who
   manipulates the ``PROJECT_CONTAINER_PREFIX`` env variable or crafts a
   malicious experiment YAML still cannot target arbitrary host containers,
   because the Docker label check (``com.docker.compose.project``) is a
   second, independent guard.

2. **Compose-project label verification** — the resolved Docker container
   MUST carry the label ``com.docker.compose.project`` matching this
   platform's own project name.  This makes it structurally impossible to
   target any container outside our own Docker Compose environment, even if
   the container name happens to match the expected pattern.

3. **Duration ceiling** — fault durations above ``MAX_FAULT_DURATION_SECONDS``
   are rejected here *in addition to* the Pydantic model validator.  Two
   independent enforcement points mean a misconfigured or patched Pydantic
   model cannot accidentally allow unbounded faults.

4. **Concurrency limit** — only one chaos experiment may run at a time.
   Compounding concurrent failures make measurement meaningless and could
   genuinely take down the entire stack.

Architectural rule
------------------
Every fault injector and DockerController method MUST call through
SafetyValidator.  No code in this codebase may call the Docker SDK for
reliability purposes without first passing through this module.
